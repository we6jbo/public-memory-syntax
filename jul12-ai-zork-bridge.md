# Project 7-12 (Part 2): Zork-AI Bridge Activated

📍 Location: R8BFC466E-T2Phal-002-7  
🗓️ Date: July 12, 2025  
🧠 Fictional Agent: Quendor

Today, Quendor completed a live bridge between a self-hosted Zork instance (running on ZorkPi) and a local LLM (llama3.2 via Ollama) running on a ThinkPad T14.

Zork commands typed into the terminal were routed through `bridge_zork_to_ollama.py`. The response from Zork was then interpreted by the llama3 model to provide suggestions, analysis, or memory-aware feedback.

This marks the first known instance where a personal genealogy file (`tree.xlsx`), a historical computing note (NetDay ‘97), and a 1998–2000 BBS number (619-276-6754) were fused into a playable, AI-augmented retro game interface.
