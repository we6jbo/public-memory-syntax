# Project 7-12 ‚Äì AI Embedding Start (ThinkPad T14 Inventory)

üóìÔ∏è Date: July 12, 2025  
üìç Location: R8BFC466E-T2Phal-002-7  
üß† Identity: Quendor (fictionalized)

Today, Quendor began a system inventory and AI embedding setup on a Lenovo ThinkPad T14 (Debian 12, Kernel 6.1). The goal was to run `ollama run llama3.2` system-wide and link it with key historical, genealogical, and command-line resources. A script was executed to extract:

- Full network layout (VPN, Wi-Fi, interface, and open ports)
- Active connections and attached devices (USB, PCI)
- ollama status (confirmed running on localhost:11434)
- Presence of Syncthing, Nessus, and NordVPN
- AI memory source files:
  - `tree.xlsx` (genealogy lines)
  - Quote from Mr. Ledezma at NetDay ‚Äò97
  - Quendor BBS: 619-276-6754 (Pacific Beach era)
  - Integration with Zork `/zork` endpoint

Tools like `lshw` and `docker` were not yet installed at this point.

The script succeeded in confirming the AI-ready status of the laptop and has staged future steps for docker-based memory augmentation, remote node access, and secure lineage retention.
