## 🗣️  Hebrew Practice and Archive

I began daily Hebrew recordings on June 15 at San Diego Central Library using phrases I wrote that day:

> Ba-bo-ker a-ni o-khel beitzim u-ba-na-na
> Ba-tso-ha-reem a-ni o-khel ye-ra-kot — me-la-fo-fon, se-le-ri, cha-sa ve-te-red
> Ba-e-rev a-ni o-khel dag ve-of ra-zeh
> A-ni o-se ha-li-kha kol yom ke-chetzi sha-ah

I’m uploading clips to Vimeo and Internet Archive under `Learn-Ivrit-Recordings`.
