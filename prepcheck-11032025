On November 6, 2025, focus on applying to at least five cybersecurity-related positions using the Wyj job application packet. Prioritize federal and state listings that align with Schedule A or LEAP eligibility. Use the Clairemont Library terminal to complete the applications before watching Video #86 of the Security+ SY0-701 series.

Based on current study progress and trajectory (having completed Video #85 by 11/3/2025), the recommended date to take the CompTIA Security+ exam is **January 25, 2026**. This allows ample time to finish all 121 videos, complete multiple rounds of practice exams, and solidify weaker domains through hands-on labs or TryHackMe-style exercises.

Do not register for the exam until you achieve consistent 90%+ scores on timed practice tests. Stay committed to weekly reviews and application routines as outlined in the Wyj plan. Momentum and mastery—not urgency—will secure long-term success.
