Ground coffee or beans (bulk bags) – brew at home with drip, French press, or pour-over.

Cold brew concentrate (store brand or big bottle) – lasts all week, just add water/milk.

Instant espresso packs – quick, portable, and cheaper than café.

Flavor add-ins – cinnamon, unsweetened cocoa, or flavored syrups you keep at home.

Milk/alt milk cartons – for lattes/shaken-style drinks.
