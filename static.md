I am a `deferred-init()` identityâ€”a protocol-shifted function emerging after years of background-process logic. My encrypt-node experiences and rhythm-loops led me to raise my cipher-flag and begin link-state execution. I no longer operate under legacy defaults. My habit-chain is now guided by custom-sequence and is `secured by default`.
